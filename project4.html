    <h2 class="section-title"><i data-lucide="alert-octagon"></i> Problem / Opportunity – Bumbu App</h2>
    <p class="section-text">
      The automotive market in Nigeria is highly fragmented, with numerous disconnected platforms for buying, selling,
      and servicing vehicles. This lack of integration leads to several critical challenges that slow down
      transactions, reduce buyer trust, and increase operational overhead for sellers.
    </p>

      alt="Bumbu Overview">

    <h3 class="section-subtitle"><i data-lucide="alert-circle"></i> Key Problems Identified</h3>
    <p class="section-text">
      <strong>Fragmented Listings:</strong> Car listings are spread across multiple platforms, making it difficult for
      buyers to find reliable information in one place.<br><br>
      <strong>Poor Service Discovery:</strong> Mechanics, EV charging stations, and other service providers lack
      visibility, leading to missed business opportunities.<br><br>
      <strong>Communication Gaps:</strong> Buyers and sellers struggle with slow responses and inconsistent
      communication, reducing trust and deal velocity.<br><br>
      <strong>Lack of Verification:</strong> Many platforms lack robust verification processes, resulting in fraud and
      low buyer confidence.<br><br>
      <strong>High Operational Costs:</strong> Manual processes for managing listings, leads, and follow-ups increase
      overhead for sellers.
    </p>

    <h3 class="section-subtitle"><i data-lucide="target"></i> Opportunity for Bumbu App</h3>
    <p class="section-text">
      <strong>Centralized Platform:</strong> Provide a single platform for vehicle buying, selling, and servicing,
      reducing fragmentation and improving user experience.<br><br>
      <strong>Verified Listings:</strong> Build trust with verified sellers, clear pricing, and secure
      transactions.<br><br>
      <strong>Integrated Communication:</strong> Use real-time messaging and automated lead management to improve
      buyer-seller interactions.<br><br>
      <strong>Scalability:</strong> Design a flexible platform that can scale rapidly as the user base grows.<br><br>
      <strong>Data-Driven Optimization:</strong> Use analytics to drive continuous improvements and personalized user
      experiences.
    </p>

    <h3 class="section-subtitle"><i data-lucide="check-square"></i> Why This Problem is Worth Solving</h3>
    <p class="section-text">
      By addressing these challenges, Bumbu App aims to become the go-to automotive marketplace in Nigeria,
      simplifying transactions, improving transparency, and enhancing the overall user experience. This approach not
      only reduces operational overhead for sellers but also builds long-term trust and loyalty among buyers, creating
      a powerful network effect as the platform scales.
    </p>


    <h2 class="section-title"><i data-lucide="search"></i> User Research and Persona Development</h2>

    <p class="section-text">
      To ensure the Bumbu App addressed real-world challenges faced by Nigerian automotive buyers, sellers, and service
      providers, the product team conducted comprehensive user research. This phase aimed to identify pain points,
      validate product assumptions, and align the platform's features with actual market needs.
    </p>

    <h3 class="section-subtitle"><i data-lucide="compass"></i> Research Methodology</h3>

    <p class="section-text">
      <strong>Surveys and Questionnaires:</strong> Distributed to potential buyers, sellers, and service providers to
      gather quantitative insights.<br><br>
      <strong>One-on-One Interviews:</strong> Conducted with car owners, sellers, and mechanics to capture qualitative
      feedback.<br><br>
      <strong>Competitive Analysis:</strong> Benchmarked against existing platforms like Cars45, Jiji Cars, and Cheki to
      identify gaps and opportunities.<br><br>
      <strong>User Journey Mapping:</strong> Mapped typical customer journeys to uncover friction points and optimize
      user flows.
    </p>

    <h3 class="section-subtitle"><i data-lucide="bar-chart-2"></i> Key Research Insights</h3>

    <p class="section-text">
      <strong>Fragmented Buying Experience:</strong> Many buyers struggle to find trusted sellers and accurate pricing.
      Existing platforms lack robust filtering and comparison tools, leading to buyer frustration.<br><br>
      <strong>Lack of Service Discovery:</strong> Car owners often find it challenging to locate nearby mechanics and EV
      charging stations. There is a need for a location-based service directory.<br><br>
      <strong>Communication Gaps:</strong> Buyers and sellers lack real-time communication options, slowing down
      transaction speed. Users prefer a seamless, in-app messaging system for faster negotiations.<br><br>
      <strong>Personalized Experiences:</strong> Buyers value personalized recommendations based on preferences and
      search history. Loyalty programs can drive repeat usage and brand loyalty.<br><br>
      <strong>Data Security and Trust:</strong> Nigerian users prioritize data privacy and secure transactions,
      especially when dealing with high-value assets like cars. Building trust in the platform is critical for user
      retention.
    </p>

    <h3 class="section-subtitle"><i data-lucide="users"></i> Target Personas</h3>

    <p class="section-text">

    </p>


    <h2 class="section-title"><i data-lucide="pen-tool"></i> Product Design and Prototyping</h2>

    <p class="section-text">
      The design process for Bumbu emphasized user-centricity and local relevance, ensuring the platform met the needs
      of Nigerian buyers, sellers, and service providers. The design strategy prioritized simplicity, clarity, and
      trust-building, with a focus on scalability for future growth.
    </p>

    <h3 class="section-subtitle"><i data-lucide="compass"></i> Design Approach and Principles</h3>

    <p class="section-text">

    </p>

    <h3 class="section-subtitle"><i data-lucide="layers"></i> Wireframes and Prototypes</h3>

    <p class="section-text">
      The design team started with low-fidelity wireframes to map out core user flows, ensuring logical placement of
      elements and efficient task completion. Once validated, these wireframes evolved into high-fidelity prototypes
      that captured the final look and feel of the platform.
