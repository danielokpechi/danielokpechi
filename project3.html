    <p class="section-text">
      BloodLink is a purpose-driven mobile app designed to transform how blood donations are sourced and managed in
      Nigeria. By connecting donors, recipients, and blood banks through a seamless digital platform, BloodLink

    <h3 class="section-subtitle"><i data-lucide="layers"></i> Industry Context</h3>
    <p class="section-text">
      Blood donation is a critical part of modern healthcare, but it faces significant challenges, including low donor
      turnout, inefficient inventory management, and poor communication between blood banks and donors. The global
      demand for blood is rising, yet many regions struggle to maintain sufficient supplies, particularly for rare blood
      types. This creates a pressing need for digital platforms that can bridge the gap between donors and blood banks,
      ensuring timely, efficient, and transparent blood management.
    </p>

    <h3 class="section-subtitle"><i data-lucide="target"></i> Project Objective</h3>
    <p class="section-text">
      To build a comprehensive digital platform that connects blood donors, blood banks, and healthcare providers,
      improving donor engagement, optimizing inventory management, and reducing critical blood shortages through
      data-driven, user-centric solutions.
    </p>

    <h3 class="section-subtitle"><i data-lucide="user-check"></i> Roles and Responsibilities</h3>
    <p class="section-text">
      As the Product Manager for BloodLink, I led the project from concept to prototype, focusing on:<br><br>
      • <strong>Market Research:</strong> Identifying user pain points and market gaps through surveys and
      interviews.<br>
      • <strong>Product Strategy:</strong> Defining the product vision, roadmap, and core features based on user needs
      and business goals.<br>
      • <strong>User Experience Design:</strong> Collaborating with designers to create intuitive, impactful user
      interfaces.<br>
      • <strong>Stakeholder Management:</strong> Aligning product goals with stakeholder expectations, including blood
      banks, healthcare professionals, and potential donors.<br>
      • <strong>Product Validation:</strong> Conducting usability testing, analyzing user feedback, and iterating
      designs to ensure product-market fit.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title"><i data-lucide="alert-octagon"></i> Market Context and Problem Statement</h2>
    <p class="section-text">
      The global blood donation ecosystem is plagued by critical inefficiencies that lead to dangerous shortages, high
      wastage, and inconsistent donor engagement. In many regions, the demand for blood consistently outstrips supply,
      while blood banks struggle to maintain accurate inventory levels. The disconnect between donors and blood banks
      results in missed opportunities, especially for rare blood types, putting lives at risk during emergencies.
    </p>

    <h3 class="section-subtitle"><i data-lucide="alert-circle"></i> Key Problems Identified</h3>
    <p class="section-text">
      • <strong>Low Donor Retention and Engagement</strong> – Many potential donors are unaware of the impact of their
      contributions or find the process too cumbersome.<br>
      <span class="data-insight">Data Insight:</span> In a survey of 200 potential donors, 65% cited lack of convenience
      and awareness as the main reasons for not donating regularly.<br><br>

      • <strong>Inventory Management Challenges</strong> – Blood banks often lack real-time visibility into their stock
      levels, leading to critical shortages and overstocking of less-needed blood types.<br>
      <span class="data-insight">Data Insight:</span> 70% of blood bank managers reported difficulty in managing
      inventory efficiently, resulting in expired units and unmet demand for specific blood types.<br><br>

      • <strong>Inefficient Communication and Donor Coordination</strong> – Blood banks struggle to maintain effective
      communication with donors, resulting in missed appointments and poor donor retention.<br>
      <span class="data-insight">Data Insight:</span> 60% of blood banks surveyed indicated that no-shows and poor
      appointment management significantly disrupt their operations.<br><br>

      • <strong>Fragmented Donor Experience</strong> – The process of finding nearby donation centers, scheduling
      appointments, and tracking donations is often fragmented and inconsistent, discouraging potential donors.<br>
      <span class="data-insight">Data Insight:</span> 80% of potential donors expressed a desire for a single,
      centralized platform to manage their donations.
    </p>

    <h3 class="section-subtitle"><i data-lucide="check-square"></i> Why This Problem is Worth Solving</h3>
    <p class="section-text">
      Blood shortages lead to avoidable deaths, while inefficient inventory management increases healthcare costs and
      reduces the overall quality of patient care. By addressing these pain points, BloodLink aims to create a more
      efficient, reliable, and transparent blood donation ecosystem that can save lives, reduce waste, and increase
      donor retention.
    </p>

    <h3 class="section-subtitle"><i data-lucide="target"></i> Opportunity Statement</h3>
    <p class="section-text">

      communications.<br>
      • <strong>Enhances Transparency:</strong> Builds trust by providing clear, real-time updates on blood availability
      and usage.
    </p>


    <h2 class="section-title"><i data-lucide="search"></i> User Research & Insights</h2>
