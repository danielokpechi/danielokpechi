    <p class="section-text">
      The traditional real estate market is fragmented and inefficient, with many realtors struggling to reach potential
      buyers and manage property listings effectively. The lack of centralized platforms for property sales, lead
      management, and buyer engagement creates significant friction in the sales process, leading to lost revenue and
      missed opportunities for real estate companies like Landview Properties.
    </p>

    <h3 class="section-subtitle"><i data-lucide="alert-circle"></i> Key Challenges Identified</h3>
    <p class="section-text">

      • <strong>Limited Data-Driven Decision Making:</strong> Realtors and property managers lack insights into user
      behavior and market trends, limiting their ability to optimize sales strategies.<br>
      <span class="data-insight">Impact:</span> Missed opportunities for targeted marketing and faster deal
      closures.<br><br>

      • <strong>Scalability and Regional Expansion:</strong> Existing platforms are not optimized for rapid scaling,
