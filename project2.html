    <h2 class="section-title"><i data-lucide="trending-up"></i> Market Context</h2>
    <p class="section-text">
      The Nigerian fintech market is rapidly expanding, driven by a young, mobile-first population with a growing demand
      for digital financial services. However, traditional banking apps often fail to address the unique needs of these
      users, creating significant market gaps and pain points.
    </p>

    <h3 class="section-subtitle"><i data-lucide="alert-triangle"></i> User Pain Points</h3>
    <p class="section-text">
      From user interviews and surveys, we identified three critical pain points that the KeepSafe app aims to solve:
      <br><br>• <strong>Terrible User Interfaces</strong> – Users often struggle with outdated, clunky designs that
      require too many steps for simple transactions.
      <br><span class="data-insight">Data Insight:</span> 65% of 500 surveyed mobile banking users in 2023 cited poor
      design and confusing navigation as their primary frustration.
      <br><br>• <strong>Limited Features and Flexibility</strong> – Many banking apps lack the ability to store multiple
      cards, manage budgets, or automate bill payments.
      <br><span class="data-insight">Data Insight:</span> 70% of users in a 2024 feedback survey expressed a desire for
      comprehensive wallet features, including multiple card storage and expense tracking.
      <br><br>• <strong>Physical Bank Dependency</strong> – During the COVID-19 pandemic, the inability to access
      physical bank branches left many users without essential financial services.
      <br><span class="data-insight">Data Insight:</span> 85% of users reported that they had to visit physical branches
      or use alternative financial apps due to the limitations of their existing banking apps.
    </p>

    <h3 class="section-subtitle"><i data-lucide="bar-chart-2"></i> Competitive Analysis (Gaps in the Market)</h3>
    <p class="section-text">
      A review of popular fintech apps like Chime, Kuda, and Alat by Wema revealed critical gaps that KeepSafe aims to
      address:
    </p>
    <img src="imgs/keepsafe/6.png" style="border-radius: 20px; width: 100%; height: auto; " alt="">
    <img src="imgs/keepsafe/7.png" style="border-radius: 20px; width: 100%; height: auto; " alt="">

    <h3 class="section-subtitle"><i data-lucide="check-circle"></i> Why This Problem is Worth Solving</h3>
    <p class="section-text">
      The combination of poor user experience, limited functionality, and reliance on physical banking has created a
      significant market opportunity. By addressing these pain points, KeepSafe can capture a large segment of young
      professionals, frequent travelers, and small business owners who prioritize convenience, security, and flexibility
      in their financial tools.
    </p>

    <h3 class="section-subtitle"><i data-lucide="compass"></i> Opportunity Statement</h3>
    <p class="section-text">
      KeepSafe aims to bridge this gap by providing a secure, all-in-one mobile banking solution that prioritizes user
      experience, multi-currency support, and flexible financial management.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title"><i data-lucide="search"></i> Research Methodology</h2>
    <p class="section-text">

    <h2 class="section-title"><i data-lucide="activity"></i> Agile Execution and Sprint Planning</h2>
    <p class="section-text">
      To keep the KeepSafe project within the 3-month timeline, a scrum-based approach was chosen, focusing on rapid
      iterations, clear priorities, and tight feedback loops. The project was divided into 3 major sprints, each
      designed to build and validate critical features quickly.
    </p>

    <h3 class="section-subtitle"><i data-lucide="flag"></i> Sprint Goals and Structure</h3>
    <p class="section-text">
      • <strong>Sprint 1 – Core Functionality:</strong> Build secure user authentication and fast onboarding.<br>
      • <strong>Sprint 2 – Financial Features:</strong> Implement multi-currency support, card management, and quick
      transfers.<br>
      • <strong>Sprint 3 – Security and Personalization:</strong> Add real-time alerts, spending limits, and dark mode
      for personalization.
    </p>

    <h3 class="section-subtitle"><i data-lucide="check-circle"></i> Sprint 1: Core Functionality</h3>
    <p class="section-text">

    </p>

    <h3 class="section-subtitle"><i data-lucide="layers"></i> Backlog Management and Prioritization</h3>
    <p class="section-text">
      Features were prioritized based on user feedback, competitive analysis, and technical feasibility. The MoSCoW
      method was used to ensure that critical features were built first, while lower-priority items were deferred to
      future releases.
    </p>

    <h3 class="section-subtitle"><i data-lucide="refresh-cw"></i> Standup Cadence and Retrospectives</h3>
    <p class="section-text">
      • <strong>Daily Standups:</strong> 15-minute sessions to discuss progress, blockers, and next steps.<br>
      • <strong>Sprint Reviews:</strong> End-of-sprint demos to validate progress and gather early feedback.<br>
      • <strong>Retrospectives:</strong> Post-sprint reflections to identify what worked, what didn’t, and how to
      improve.
    </p>

    <h3 class="section-subtitle"><i data-lucide="alert-octagon"></i> Challenges and Workarounds</h3>
    <p class="section-text">
      • <strong>Security vs Speed:</strong> Balancing fast logins with robust security led to the adoption of biometric
      authentication as the default.<br>
      • <strong>Complex Card Management:</strong> Early user tests revealed the need for clearer card actions, leading
      to a redesigned card management dashboard.<br>
      • <strong>Multi-Currency Complexity:</strong> Streamlined currency switching based on user feedback to reduce
      cognitive load.
    </p>

    <h3 class="section-subtitle"><i data-lucide="bulb"></i> Key Learnings and Retrospective</h3>
    <p class="section-text">
      • <strong>Balancing Security and Usability:</strong> Biometric login significantly improved user trust without
      adding friction.<br>
      • <strong>Simplified Card Management:</strong> Early user feedback drove key UI improvements, reducing confusion
      and task completion times.<br>
      • <strong>Continuous User Feedback is Critical:</strong> Regular testing cycles helped identify pain points early,
      reducing the risk of post-launch churn.
